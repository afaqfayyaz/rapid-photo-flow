# RapidPhotoFlow Frontend

React + TypeScript frontend with modern UI and feature-based architecture.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

The frontend will start on `http://localhost:3000`

## Build

```bash
npm run build
```

## Architecture

- **Feature-based**: Each feature (photos, processing, events) is self-contained
- **Core/Shared**: Reusable components and services
- **TypeScript**: Full type safety
- **CSS Modules**: Scoped styling
